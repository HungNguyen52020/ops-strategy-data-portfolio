# Operations & Strategy-Oriented Data Portfolio

## About Me
I am an operations and planning-oriented data professional with a background spanning retail operations, construction project delivery, and large-scale workforce management.

I specialize in using data not just for reporting, but for operational planning, decision-making, and strategy under real-world constraints such as cost, capacity, service levels, and people limitations.

My experience includes leading and supporting decisions across workforce planning, cost optimization, and performance management for operations ranging from small retail teams to large-scale projects with over 1,000 headcount.

## What This Portfolio Represents
This portfolio focuses on how data is applied to support:

- Workforce and capacity planning  
- Cost and resource optimization  
- Operational decision-making  
- Scenario analysis and trade-off evaluation  

> Due to confidentiality obligations, all projects are shared using visuals, abstractions, and business-level explanations rather than raw data or proprietary logic.
